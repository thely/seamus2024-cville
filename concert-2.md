## Program Notes and Artist Details

### Arianna (so much) / Summer (1964)
The two pieces presented here are part of a larger work based on the work of artist, Agnes Martin. Martin’s work has been described as being made up of “small repetitive gestures and simple means” – often visual grids. That same approach informs **Arianna (so much)** and **Summer (1964) (after Agnes Martin)**; the pieces are largely made out of field recordings processed through a small eurorack setup and manually triggered sine waves controlled by software of the composer’s design.

**Benjamin Broening** is a composer of orchestral, choral, chamber and electroacoustic music. He is the recipient of a numerous awards including Guggenheim, Howard and Fulbright Fellowships.  His music has been performed in more than twenty-five countries and has been widely recorded including solo discs on Bridge (with Eighth Blackbird) and Innova (with Duo Runedako) as well as works on Centaur, Everglade, Equilibrium, MIT Press, New Focus, Oberlin Music, Open G, Ravello and SEAMUS labels, and by Ensemble U: in Estonia. He is founder and director of Third Practice Electroacoustic Music Festival at the University of Richmond where is Professor of Music.
 
### 3200 Phaethon / The Limits Of 1.5C / Sasquatch v Bunyan

I am a sonic artist. Additional monikers include: composer, audio engineer, sound designer, performer, programmer, hacker, maker. The use of technology plays a vital role in my work. Algorithmic process, chance procedure, and structured improvisations inform the sonic results.

### Prism of Distortions

**"Prism of Distortions"** is an electro-acoustic, interactive audio-visual performance. At the intersection between familiar and unfamiliar, chaos and order, movement and stagnation, this work expresses the border, lines, and limits of our invisible tolerance level for cultural and societal norms through a temporal and textural coalescence. Here, prism symbolically stands for a range of hues, textures, colors, and views; for some, disorder is order, and noise is beauty, but for others, the opposite is true. This piece features cello (or violin) improvisation and fixed media with live electronics.

**Cecilia Suhr** is an award-winning intermedia artist and researcher, multi-instrumentalist (violin/cello/voice/piano/bamboo flute), multimedia composer, interaction designer, painter, author, and improviser. She has won multiple awards in the field of music, art, interactive media, and academic research, including the American Prize (Honorable Mention), MacArthur Foundation, Digital Media and Learning Research Grant Award, Pauline Oliveros Award from the IAWM, Silver Medal Award from the International Cambridge Music Competition, Bronze Medal Winner from the Global Music Awards, Best of Competition Winner in Interactive Media and Emerging Technologies from the Broadcast Education Association, Saint Michael Achievement Medal from International Juried Fine Arts Competition, etc. Her music has been performed and featured at the ICMC, SEAMUS, EMM, SCI, NYCEMF, ACMC, Tenor, Convergence, International Multimedia Arts Festival, New Music Gathering, Splice Festival, New Music on the Bayou, Performing Media Art Festival, Mantis Festival, VU Symposium, Turn Up Festival, Hot Air Music Festival, Moxonic Festival, Beast Feast, Harvard University, Yale University, ISSTA, Klint Gut, among many others. She is the author of “Social Media and Music” (Peter Lang Press, 2012) and “Evaluation and Credentialing in Digital Music Communities” (MIT Press, 2014). Currently, she is an Associate Professor in the Department of Humanities and Creative Arts at Miami University Regionals.

### hypothetical particles

**Hypothetical particles** in physics refer to particles that have not yet been observed and proven to exist. However, these particles are necessary for maintaining consistency within a given physical theory. In this composition, I explore this phenomenon by examining the interaction between particles of light and sound. The amplitudes of the lights trigger changes in the music, revealing connections between the natural and synthetic realms of sound.

To facilitate this exploration, I utilize a handmade digital photo controller called the light instrument. This instrument consists of 16 light-dependent resistors and is a replication of *light.void~*, originally designed by Felipe Tovar-Henao, an alumnus of Indiana University, who was inspired by Leafcutter John's *light thing*.

I dedicate this piece to Felipe Tovar-Henao, who is not only a good friend but also an important mentor and a significant source of inspiration that motivated me to pursue music composition.

Born in Guangdong, China, **Zouning**’s music draws inspiration from her fascination with nature and technology, blended with a constant curiosity about the playing capacity of instruments. She endeavors to incorporate unexpected and everyday sounds into her music.

Her music has been performed in the United States, France, China, and England. In 2023, her work was featured in the Musicacoustica Hangzhou Electronic Music Festival, Electronic Music Midwest, CampGround23, Turn Up 2023, SPLICE Festival, and Everyday is Spatial 2023. She was honored to also be featured in New York City Electroacoustic Music Festival (2022), SEAMUS national conference in (2021, 2022), National Student Electronic Music Event (2021), and the Society of Composers Inc. (2021). Zouning was named a finalist in the ASCAP/ SEAMUS Student Composer Commission Competition in 2021.

Zouning is currently pursuing a master’s degree with double majors in electronic music composition and music theory at Indiana University Jacobs School of Music. She also serves as an Associate Instructor of Music Theory and teaches written and aural theory at undergraduate level. She holds a bachelor’s degree from the same institution where she studies with David Dzubay, John Gibson, and Chi Wang among other notable mentors. In summer 2023, Zouning earned a certification from the CIEE Paris Contemporary Music Creation and Critique Program, ManiFeste & I’Académie at IRCAM- Centre Pompidou in Paris, France.

### eight fields

**eight fields** is an improvisational framework that explores the infinite possibilities achievable when creating electronic music. With each movement, the goal is to explore different techniques, instruments, and musical approaches to creating and performing sound.

**Octothorpe** is an emerging live electronics duo based out of North Texas with a focus in experimental music in intermedia. Its members consist of Nolen Liu and Joshua “JD” Fuller, who are both currently pursuing undergraduate degrees at the University of North Texas with focuses in electronic music performance and composition.

### Trash Cats
