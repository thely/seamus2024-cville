## Program Notes and Artist Details

### kinhin

Agnes Martin was a well-known abstract painter who spent much of her later life in northern New Mexico where she built her own home and lived austerely. Her painting process involved waiting for images to appear in her mind as small squares and then making long-hand calculations to upscale them exactly to the size of her 6x6 foot canvases. Critics often suggested her work was about landscape but she insisted it was not. This impressionistic psycho-biography colludes landscape and mindscape, playing with the materiality of analog and digital video to evoke a felt-sense of Martin’s life and work.

### Roseville

**“Roseville”** is part of a film tryptich and installation exploring spaces of forgotten or hidden labor at active and abandoned railway sites on the U.S. West Coast. The film layers images of past and present, old and new infrastructures, and archival images of workers from early in the site's history, through driving and aerial shots along the Roseville Yard, which is the largest active pacific union railyard west of the Rockies.

**Caroline Louise Miller** (they/them) is a US composer based in Portland, Oregon. Their work broadly explores affect, ecology, labor politics, tactility, and digital materiality, often addressing contemporary issues within dreamlike musical spaces that thread field recordings, shimmering textures, and romantic melodic lines through harsh noise and clattering dissonances. They have most recently received grants, fellowships, and commissions through Alarm Will Sound, SPLICE Ensemble with funding from Chamber Music America, Guerilla Opera, Transient Canvas, and Ensemble Adapter. In 2018 they won the ISB/David Walter Composition Competition for Hydra Nightingale, created with improvisor and bassist Kyle Motl. Recent projects include Superlunary, a collection of acousmatic soundscapes for improvisation, with George Colligan; and Here-There, a multimedia installation with Alarm Will Sound and digital media artist Stefani Byrd that explores layered histories of labor at abandoned and active California railroad sites. C.L.M.'s music appears across the U.S. and internationally. Caroline is Assistant Professor of Music in Sonic Arts at Portland State University, and holds a Ph.D in Music from UC San Diego. Stefani Byrd’s (she/they) art practice includes video, new media, and interactive technologies. Byrd’s early work addressed social justice issues in the form of interactive temporary public art installations that created role reversal, or "empathy training,” experiences for the audience. Her current work focuses on creating psychologically charged immersive media environments addressing topics such as digital feminism, gun violence, and how technology impacts empathy in digitally mediated spaces. Her work has been exhibited at places such as the CICA Museum (South Korea), SONIC MATTER New Music Festival (Zurich), Museum of Contemporary Art of Alicante (Spain), Athens Digital Arts Festival (Greece), the Museum of Contemporary Art of San Diego (San Diego), the Museum of Contemporary Art of Georgia (Atlanta), San Luis Obispo Museum of Art (San Luis Obispo), A.I.R. Gallery (Brooklyn), Artist Television Access (San Francisco), and the Athens Institute for Contemporary Art (Athens). Byrd’s work is held in the permanent collections of the Museum of Contemporary Art of Georgia and the Columbus Museum of American Art. Byrd is currently Assistant Professor of Experimental Media in the Film Studies Department at the University of North Carolina Wilmington, and is the Founding Director of the Intersectional Feminist Media Lab embedded in the University of North Carolina Wilmington’s Film Studies Department. The IFML is a space focused on equitable access, training, education, awareness, and representation for marginalized identities and voices in media.

### Performance: Anxiety

**Performance: Anxiety** is an exploration of the composer’s experiences with social anxiety. Centering around poetry written by the composer, sounds shift between the internal and external, growing in deviation and distortion as anxiety takes hold.

**Jared Bradley Tubbs**, native to Tuscaloosa, Alabama, is a composer, percussionist, and music technologist pursuing his DMA in Music Composition at the University of Georgia. Previously, he has earned a Master of Arts in Music and Master of Music in Music Composition from Western Michigan University, studying under Dr. Lisa Coons and Dr. Christopher Biggs. Additionally, he has earned a Bachelor's degree in Music Composition at the University of Alabama, studying under Dr. Amir Zaheri. Since beginning his studies, Jared Bradley Tubbs has had numerous presentations of his research and creative work. His compositional and research interests center around exploring extramusical concepts through experimental music and music technology.

### Once Called Dominion

**Gabrielle Cerberville** (b. 1991 in Sleepy Hollow, NY) is a curious American composer turned creative alchemist. She writes with an experimental flair that is at once familiar and alien, and her work regularly blends the lines between disciplines and discrete art forms. Her work is an exploration of communication, primarily between humans and our natural neighbors (plants, fungi, animals, and finding our place within ecosystems). She holds a Masters of Music in composition from Western Michigan University and a Bachelor of Music from Butler University in composition, and is pursuing her Ph.D in Music Composition and Computer Technologies at the University of Virginia. Gabrielle has studied traditional and electronic composition with Drs. Lisa Coons, Christopher Biggs, Frank Felice and Michael Schelle. She is also a well-known figure in the mycology and foraging communities, and lectures widely about sustainability, edible wild plants and fungi, identification, and environmental activism. 

**Carter John Rice** is an assistant professor of Multimedia Arts Technology at Western Michigan University. A native of Minot, North Dakota, Rice is not only a composer but also an audio engineer and educator drawn to music through a desire to instill knowledge in others. He is passionate about music education and enjoys teaching music at all levels. As a composer, Rice draws inspiration from a wide array of sources including acoustic phenomena, cognitive science, and classical mechanics. His music has been featured at venues such as the national SEAMUS conference, the national conference for the Society of Composers Inc. (SCI), the International Computer Music Conference, Electronic Music Midwest, and the Electroacoustic Barn Dance.

### Paisajes Oníricos/Dreamscapes

**Paisajes Oníricos/Dreamscapes** reflects on the traditional representation of graphic scores as drawings on a two- dimensional plane. The piece expands on this notion by allocating the graphical elements in a 3D virtual environment. These elements acquire volume and mass, in addition to the incorporation of a spatio-temporal dimension that is controlled by a virtual conductor. This is a solo rendering of the piece that uses a custom digital instrument built in Max/MSP to perform the piece.

**Matias Vilaplana Stark** is a Chilean music technologist, composer, and improviser. He is currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Composition and Computer Technologies program at the University of Virginia. He holds a BFA from the Music Technology program at Universidad de Chile, and a MA in Media Arts from the University of Michigan. His research interests lie at the intersection of immersive media and musical practice, working on designing interactive music environments with motion capture systems, virtual reality, and the creation of 3D virtual environments as graphic scores for musical improvisation. In his music, field recordings, sound synthesis and samples from musical instruments are combined through different processing and editing techniques to blur the lines between real-world and abstract sounds to produce fictional soundscapes that cross over into the magical realm.

### Territorio Prismático
L2Ork Tweeter-based international community ensemble presents **Territorio Prismático** co-created telematic EDM work devised using L2Ork Tweeter software that allows for perfect sync among performers, regardless of their physical distance. Every facet of the ensuing theme and variations on the select excerpts from three EDM works is co-created by its ensemble members. The work will be premiered live with performers being over 5,000 miles apart. Territorio Prismático is inspired by the bass line of the "roygbiv" EDM song by the Boards of Canada.

Named as one of the top six national transdisciplinary exemplars (a2ru, 2015), and one of the top eight research projects at Virginia Tech (DCist, 2014), a contemporary multimedia ensemble **Linux Laptop Orchestra** or **L2Ork** (pronounced as 'lohrk'), explores the collaborative nature of ensemble-based musicking through the use of innovative human-computer interaction technologies. L2Ork seeks integrative approach to arts, design, engineering, and science, and nurtures communities eager to explore the boundaries of music through technology.

Founded by Dr. Ivica Ico Bukvic in May 2009, L2Ork is part of an interdisciplinary initiative by Virginia Tech College of Architecture, Arts, and Design, the School of Performing Arts and its DISIS Interactive Sound & Intermedia Studio (DISIS), and the Institute for Creativity, Arts, and Technology (ICAT). As the world’s first Linux-based laptop orchestra incorporating extensive study of gesture and Taiji (Tai Chi) choreography and other extended performance techniques L2Ork offers optimal infrastructure for creative research at minimal cost. By pursuing a seamless integration of arts, design, science, and engineering, it in part seeks to bridge the gap between STEM and the Arts, with particular focus on K-12 education.

Since its inception, the initiative has helped start seven laptop orchestras in North and South Americas. L2Ork's infrastructural backbone Pd-L2Ork, a visual programming environment with its unique K-12 learning module has been utilized in dozens of K-12 Maker workshops, including the 2014 Raspberry Pi Orchestra summer gifted program, and the ongoing 13-year partnership with the Boys & Girls Club of SW VA. In 2020, the ensemble introduced L2Ork Tweeter, its new free and open-source online platform for collaborative instrument design, ideation, improvisation, composition, rehearsal, and performance, that has served as a foundation for an international L2Ork community ensemble. http://l2ork.music.vt.edu

### Ghost Stories

Tacked onto the end of an otherwise ordinary manuscript by a monk around the turn of the 15th century, the Byland Abbey Ghost Stories depict spectral encounters between medieval residents of Yorkshire both from this life and the next. In most of the tales, the ghosts appear to the living as shapeshifters seeking absolution to escape from purgatory, ending with the ghosts resting in peace after a struggle with the conjurer. James C. Joyce narrates this rendition of the first tale. 

### I Wasn't Thinking

An immersive multimedia project, using fixed electronics, projections, and audience cell phones, this piece is loosely inspired by guided meditations, which ironically are frequently done using cell phones, despite their distracting and often stress-inducing presence in our lives. More broadly, I was interested in how a lack of thought is strangely both a goal for meditation and simultaneously viewed as a pitfall of technology, which may numb and disable thought. At the beginning of the piece, the audience is instructed to scan QR codes which direct them to one of two possible video/audio tracks which they will play from their phones, beginning after a countdown provided via the projection, resulting in an immersive soundscape emanating from all the audience cell phones.

**Andrew Burke** is interested in exploring music’s ability to address and elucidate complex issues, providing spaces and experiences for the listener to reflect. After working in political communications for four years, he returned to music and recently completed his master's degree at the Peabody Institute, where he studied with Christopher Cerrone and Kevin Puts. Burke began writing music in high school as a pop musician. His former band, The Da Vincis, released their debut album during their Junior year, which Robert Christgau praised for displaying a “mastery of the three-minute pop song.” In 2020, he won second place in Peabody’s Prix d’Été competition and was named a finalist for the Kaleidoscope Orchestra's Call for Scores. In 2021, he was selected as a Merriweather District Artist in Residence and completed his first feature-length film score for Brutal Season (Lil Cowboy, prod.). His work has been recognized by various awards and organization including Peabody’s Prix d’Été electronic music competition, the Macht Orchestral Composition Competition, the Delillo Composition Competition, Score Follower, University of Pennsylvania’s David Halstead Music Prize, and the Kaleidoscope Orchestra’s Call for Scores. He has held artist residencies at the Kimmel Harding Nelson Center for the Arts and the Merriweather District Artist in Residence. He continues to create pop music under the moniker Danke Shane, most recently releasing his second EP Future Real Ones in 2021 with Tape Dad Records. He is currently pursuing a PhD at the University of Pennsylvania where he has studied with Natacha Diels and Tyshawn Sorey.

### Hex on Math

**Hex on Math** revolves around bespoke hardware and software systems the authors have designed and created. Some instruments in the system produce electronic sound directly via the infamous 40106 CMOS chip; others function as custom controllers for Ableton, Max and Touch Designer software. The instruments are performed via physical controls and light-sensitive electronics combined with computer-controlled LEDs that necessitate considered placement and add a performative dimension to the system, as the interplay of ambient and direct light influences sonic textures and rhythmic patterns. The overall goal is to situate and present initial explorations in affordances of DIY instruments and light manipulation and control in a feedback system as catalysts in an immersive audiovisual context. 

**Nicole Carroll** is a composer, performer, sound designer, and builder working with audio, video, and tangible objects. Her work spans installation, improvisation, and fixed media performance, across noise, soundscape, and acousmatic genres. She is active as a sound designer and composer in theatre, performs electronic music under the alias “n0izmkr,” and builds custom synthesizers, controllers, and performance sensor systems. Her research focuses on generative systems that merge analog and digital technologies to create musical performance systems from non-musical sources. She received an M.A. and Ph.D. in Computer Music and Multimedia from Brown University in Providence, RI, USA and is currently Sr. Lecturer in Music at Queensland University of Technology (QUT) in Brisbane, Australia. nicolecarrollmusic.com

**John Robert Ferguson** is a post-digital/electronic musician, multimedia artist, and artistic researcher based in Brisbane, Australia as Associate Professor and Head of Creative Music Technology at Queensland Conservatorium Griffith University. John builds tactile interactive systems, investigates the performance-practice of electronic music, and explores creative technology in various exhibition and performance contexts. John characterises his work as “post-digital” and suggests that this is less about being in control of a situation and more about ways to find lifelike resonances with which to interact; the relationship between imagination, expectation, and material is foreground. 

### Entries

In **Entries**, the concept of journaling is interpreted by three different media streams—video, sound, and narration. The individual entries move freely between the media streams—a scene viewed early in the film may be described later, creating asynchronous cross-modality resonances.

**Stephen Lilly** is a genderqueer composer, performer, audio engineer, poet, and amateur accountant. Their music ranges from “just dark” and “so demanding on the listener” (The Retriever) to “really more ‘performance art’...the sort of thing you are very glad to have experienced without necessarily wanting to revisit it” (The Washington Post). Steph has degrees from the University of Idaho (composition/bass performance) and the University of Maryland (composition). They also spent a year studying electroacoustic music at the Institute of Sonology in The Hague. Their work ranges from abstract and microtonal to theatrical and satiric; they mostly compose chamber music for friends and friends of friends as well as fixed media works for nobody in particular. Their writings on contemporary experimental music have been published in Organised Sound, Performance Research, Perspectives of New Music, and Computer Music Journal. Recordings of their compositions have been released by SEAMUS, the Society of Composers Inc., C7 Music and the New Mexico Contemporary Ensemble, while recordings they have engineered have been released on Neuma, Navona, and Albany Records. Their scores are available through stephenlilly.net. On a final note, Steph used to teach but now just lives in DC, where they continue to compose and perform. 

### The Way Back

**‘The Way Back'** was the result of a process of reconnection—navigating out of debilitating pandemic-induced stasis and rediscovering moments of joy in what I see as an "apocalyptic" creative process. It was also a byproduct of re-forging my relationship with my primary instrument—electric guitar. The video was created from real-time screen captures of flight simulation software, and the musical composition is a tape piece assembled from several improvised electric guitar performances.

**Varun Kishore** is a guitarist and composer from Kolkata, India. His work explores interdisciplinary approaches to music technology, literature, and the audiovisual, with a focus on designing frameworks for composition and improvisation to investigate what he sees as the ‘apocalyptic’ nature of creative practice. Varun's recent work has been performed by the Tokyo Gen’on Project, Popebama, and Hypercube. His work has also been presented at SEAMUS, the New York City Electroacoustic Music Festival, the South Bend Museum of Art, Performing Media Festival, and Earth Day Art Model. His current areas of interest include drone and experimental electronic music, metal studies, alternative notation, and video. Varun is a graduate of the University of West London (BMus Popular Music Performance, 2012) and Goldsmiths, University of London (MMus Creative Practice, 2019). He is currently a PhD student in the Composition & Computer Technologies program at the University of Virginia. (www.varunkishore.net)
